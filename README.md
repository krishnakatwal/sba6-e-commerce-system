How you implemented TypeScript features and OOP principles.

Built a product module using TypeScript and object-oriented programming. Fetched data from an API and turned each product into a Product class instance. Calculated discounts and taxes using reusable functions, and handled errors to keep the app running smoothly. Used TypeScript types and async/await to make the code safe and easy to maintain.

The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
The challenges I encountered were fetching asynchronous API data, ensuring type safety, and performing clean calculations. I overcame these by using async/await, TypeScript types with a Product class, and reusable utility functions for discountsCalculator and taxesCalculator. I also implemented error handling with try/catch to manage API failures .


How you handled asynchronous operations and error management.
I handled asynchronous operations using async/await to ensure that data was fully loaded before processing. I managed error handling with try/catch blocks, logging meaningful messages for network or data issues, which kept the application stable and easy to debug.
